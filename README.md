# MIND
Microsoft News Dataset is a large-Scale English dataset for news recommendation research. This repository provides the script to evaluate models and a sample submission for MIND News Recommendation Challenge.

# Additions
This fork provides an additional script sources.py that finds the source for most of the news in the MIND. This only works for news, which are still online on the MSN website.
